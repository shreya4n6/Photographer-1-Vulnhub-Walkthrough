# Photographer-1-Vulnhub-Walkthrough
Here is a walk through for Photographer:1 which is a vulnerable machine on Vulnhub. It was created by Shreya Talukdar. This machine was developed to prepare for OSCP. It is boot2root, tested on VirtualBox (but works on VMWare) and has two flags: user.txt and proof.txt.

Check out the docs provided !! :heart:
